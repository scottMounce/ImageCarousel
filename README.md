## Usage

> 1: Run 'npm install' from the root. This installs the necessary dependencies for the service to run.
> 2: Run 'npm run build' from the root. This will bundle the React components into a single file that is run as a script from the index.html file. This ensures that service can be run in older browsers.
> 3: Run 'npm run init_db' from the root. This will create the database and tables this service relies on and seed the tables with some example data.
> 4: Run 'npm start' from the root. This will start the server on port 3001, and the server will respond to a request to root by serving up a static file--the index.html that runs our bundle created in step 2.
